### Keep Filenames Consistent
When you replace generated images with professional ones later, **use the same filenames** to avoid updating HTML again!

### Test Locally First
Always test with generated images locally before deploying to ensure paths are correct.

### Gradual Replacement
You can replace images one-by-one as you get better assets. No need to replace all at once!

### Backup Generated Images
Keep a copy of generated placeholders in case you need to reference the colors or sizing.
